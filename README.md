**Description:**  
Applied a wide range of data analysis techniques in the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), where I practiced data cleaning, validation, and joining using Python. I gained expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and probability theory, utilizing methods like t-tests, Chi-squared tests, and regression analysis to assess data. I built and interpreted linear regression, multiple linear regression, and binomial logistic regression models to analyze data relationships and make predictions. In machine learning, I explored both supervised and unsupervised learning, applying models like decision trees, random forests, and K-means clustering, while managing overfitting and understanding the bias-variance tradeoff. Throughout the certification, I completed real-world projects, applying these techniques to solve complex business problems and derive actionable insights.

**Duration:**  
Approximately 6 months at 10 hours per week to complete (Coursera estimate).
